How to use:

I.) Choose one image on webpage:
1.) Read file from a directory, with description
2.) Extract IPTC-Metadata from file, if any
3.) Write file as document and IPTC-Metadata and description as References into MongoDB
4.) Add References from NAV (Article, Text de/en, References) to file

II.) Choose directory on webpage:
1.) recursive-flag: read all files in chosen directory and do it again for all subfolders (graph!)
2.) proof if file is image-file (jpg, gif, tiff, raw, psd ... ?)
3.) do I.) for all images found
4.) use a description given on webpage, add count of image saved to db

III.) Display images:
1.) Via search page (search all refValues and add refTypes and dependent RefNames as possibilities to filter; also show history)
2.) Via random gallery

IV.) Update images:
1.) images as well as metatags can be changed
2.) previous data should be kept in mongodb


Where Spring Batch will be working:
- to read in files directories, walk through a graph
- to update the database if files in directory (or their metadata) have been changed
- to update files in a directory with new metadata
- to save (one, some or all) file(s) from database into a directory
